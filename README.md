# A-algorithm
implements the A* algorithm to find a path from any two given nodes.  
In a fully-observable environment where there are both pathable and blocked nodes, 
an agent must find a good path from their starting node to the goal node.  
The agent must use the A* algorithm to determine its path.  For this program, 
you must use the Manhattan method for calculating the heuristic.
